New Super Mario Bros Background Set
Ripped by Treeki
Graphics copyright Nintendo, 2006.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
DISCLAIMER FOR USE:
These backgrounds may have graphical errors or palette problems. Some were slightly touched up by me to fix missing tiles, and my custom ripping tool does not support more than one palette. I've tried to leave out those with problems, but some may still remain. Use at your own risk.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These have taken ages to rip, including writing my own program to extract the backgrounds and getting them to appear correctly. Give major credit if used, please.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Although only 17 are in this package, I am ripping more which I will update this submission with. Keep checking back!
I would also like to thank Someguy for helping me solve various problems I encountered while writing my NSC ripper.
