OK, another rip, from your favorite ripper, Luigifan64!
This time, I've ripped almost all of your favorite tunes from NSMB DS. And best of all, it's in MIDI format!

Firstly, give credit to me(Luigifan64)for ripping it, and Nintendo for making these tunes.

Secondly, this should only be on MFGG.
If you find this anywhere else,(Example: A link from Youtube)please PM me at MFGG.

Thirdly, I did not see any soundtracks on the internet,(One had a megaupload link, but since Megaupload is not available anymore, I could not download.)So I made my own!
Some sounds are not here, so look those up.

NOTE: I don't know the official names of the songs, I just guessed.

Enjoy these fabulous tunes!
